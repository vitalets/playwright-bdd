# Write your first BDD test

Follow the steps below to create and run your first BDD test with Playwright-BDD.

?> This guide uses JavaScript for simplicity, but you can use TypeScript as well.

### Step 1: Create configuration file

Create the following `playwright.config.js` in the project root:

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { defineBddConfig } from 'playwright-bdd';

const testDir = defineBddConfig({
  features: 'sample.feature',
  steps: 'steps.js',
});

export default defineConfig({
  testDir,
  reporter: 'html',
});
```

### Step 2: Create feature file

Create a feature file named `sample.feature`:

```gherkin
Feature: Playwright site

    Scenario: Check get started link
        Given I am on home page
        When I click link "Get started"
        Then I see in title "Installation"
```

### Step 3: Implement steps

Implement the steps in `steps.js`:

```ts
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { createBdd } from 'playwright-bdd';

const { Given, When, Then } = createBdd();

Given('I am on home page', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
});

When('I click link {string}', async ({ page }, name) => {
  await page.getByRole('link', { name }).click();
});

Then('I see in title {string}', async ({ page }, keyword) => {
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(new RegExp(keyword));
});
```

> There are alternative ways of defining steps: [Decorators](writing-steps/decorators.md) and [Cucumber-style syntax](writing-steps/cucumber-style.md).

### Step 4: Run tests

Generate and run the tests:

```
npx bddgen && npx playwright install && npx playwright test
```

Command for **Yarn**
```
yarn bddgen && yarn playwright install && yarn playwright test
```

Command for **pnpm**:
```
pnpm bddgen && pnpm playwright install && pnpm playwright test
```

Output:

```
Running 1 test using 1 worker
1 passed (2.0s)

To open the last HTML report, run:

npx playwright show-report
```

HTML report:

![Playwright HTML report](./_media/playwright-report.png ':size=70%')

### Step 5: Check the generated tests (optional)

Check out the `.features-gen` directory to see what the generated tests look like.
You will see something like this:

```js
// Generated from: sample.feature
import { test } from 'playwright-bdd';

test.describe('Playwright site', () => {

  test('Check get started link', async ({ Given, When, Then }) => {
    await Given('I am on home page');
    await When('I click link "Get started"');
    await Then('I see in title "Installation"');
  });

});
```

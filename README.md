## Why BDD?
In the era of AI, you can take [BDD](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/) approach to the next level:

- ü§ñ **Generate**: Drop business requirements into an AI chat and instantly get feature files.
- ‚úÖ **Validate**: Refine the generated scenarios with AI or colleagues, collaborate in plain text instead of code.
- üõ† **Automate**: [Use existing steps](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/chatgpt) to run the tests and prevent codebase growth.

## Why Playwright Runner?

Both [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [CucumberJS](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) have their own test runners. You can use the CucumberJS runner with [Playwright as a library](https://playwright.dev/docs/library) to execute BDD scenarios. This package offers **an alternative**: convert BDD scenarios into test files and run them directly with Playwright. You gain all the advantages of the Playwright runner:

- Automatic browser initialization and cleanup
- Auto-capture of screenshots, videos, and traces
- Parallelization with sharding
- Auto-waiting for page elements
- Built-in visual comparison testing
- Power of Playwright fixtures
- [...and more](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#key-differences)

## Extras
Playwright-BDD extends Playwright with BDD capabilities, offering:

- üî• Advanced tagging [by path](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/tags-from-path) and [special tags](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/special-tags)
- üé© [Step decorators](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/decorators) for class methods  
- üéØ [Scoped step definitions](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/scoped)  
- ‚ú® [Exporting steps](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/chatgpt) for AI  
- ‚ôªÔ∏è [Re-usable step functions](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/reusing-step-fn)

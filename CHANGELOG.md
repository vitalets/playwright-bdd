* Support feature level `@fixture:` tags [#52](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/52)).

## 5.2.0

* **possibly breaking:** Introduce `featuresRoot` option to have more control of generated files structure [#44](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/44).

  This fix actually reverts simplification of `outputDir` by common parent (added in v5, see [#40](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/40)).

  *❤️ I need to admit that automatic simplification of `outputDir` structure was not the right choice. Playwright heavily relies on tests structure for storing screenshots and we should keep it as stable as possible. I don't like such reverting but better to do it now than later. Introduced `featuresRoot` allows to strictly control output structure in the same way as TypeScript controls it with [rootDir](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#rootDir).*

  *If you use screenshots/snapshots you may need to re-save them to new paths after upgrading.*

* Add CLI command `bddgen export`.
* New [documentation website](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/).
* Suppress `publishQuiet` deprecation warning for Cucumber v9.4+, see [#47](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/47)

## 5.1.0

* Add `bddgen env` command to display environment info.

## 5.0.1
There are several breaking changes in this release. Please check carefully after upgrade.
* **breaking:** Optimize world initialization, rename `World` -> `BddWorld`, `WorldOptions` -> `BddWorldOptions`.
  *If you use these classes you may need to rename it as well*
* **breaking:** Resolve paths relative to Playwright config file, not to `process.cwd()`.
  *If you use custom Playwright config file you may need to update paths in it*
* **breaking:** Simplify generated directories structure [#40](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/40).
  *If you use snapshots you may need to re-save them in new paths*
* Improve support for several calls of `defineBddConfig()` [#39](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/39)
